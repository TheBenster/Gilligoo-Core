# Testing OAuth and Data Issues

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Fixed OAuth Configuration
- **Problem**: `lib/auth.js` had empty providers array
- **Solution**: Moved complete authOptions to `lib/auth.js` and exported it
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `lib/auth.js` - Now has complete auth config with debug logging
  - `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` - Now imports from lib/auth.js

### 2. Added Visual Feedback for Auth Status
- **Green pulsing dot + "Admin" badge** when you're logged in as admin
- **Red "Not Admin" badge** if you're logged in but not the admin user
- **GitHub login button** when not logged in
- **Red "Sign Out" button** when you're admin (more visible)

### 3. Added Debug Logging
The console will now show:
- üîç Sign in attempts with GitHub ID comparison
- üìã Session creation with admin status
- üîí Every admin check with detailed info
- ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for access granted/denied

## How to Test:

1. **Start dev server**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ben/Documents/0_repos/goblin-merchant blog/goblin-merchant-chronicles"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open http://localhost:3000**

3. **Check the navbar** - You should see:
   - If NOT logged in: Green "Admin Login" button with GitHub icon
   - If logged in as admin: Green badge with pulsing dot + your name + red "Sign Out" button
   - If logged in but NOT admin: Red "Not Admin" badge + "Sign Out" button

4. **Try to create content without logging in**:
   - Go to /write
   - Try to create a post
   - You should get an error: "Unauthorized. Please sign in."
   - Check console for üîí REQUIRE ADMIN CHECK logs

5. **Log in as admin**:
   - Click "Admin Login" 
   - Authorize with GitHub
   - Should see green admin badge in navbar
   - Now try creating content - should work

6. **Check MongoDB data**:
   - Go to /blog - check if posts show up
   - Go to /lore - check if lore shows up
   - Go to /inventory - check if items show up

## If Data Still Doesn't Show:

Your database might be empty. Check MongoDB Atlas:
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Find your cluster "goblin-chronicles"
3. Click "Browse Collections"
4. Check if you have data in:
   - `posts` collection
   - `lores` collection
   - `inventories` collection

If collections are empty, you need to create content through the UI after logging in.

## Common Issues:

### "OAuth not working"
- Check console for üîç SIGNIN CHECK logs
- Your GitHub ID should be: 105664089
- Make sure .env.local has: `ADMIN_GITHUB_ID=105664089`

### "I can write without being logged in"
- Check console for üîí REQUIRE ADMIN CHECK logs
- Should see ‚ùå if not logged in
- If you see ‚úÖ but you're not logged in, there's a bug

### "Data doesn't show in local dev"
- Check browser console for errors
- Check if MongoDB connection is successful
- Database might be empty - add content through UI
